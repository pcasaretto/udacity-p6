"variable","name","units","description"
"alcohol","Alcohol Concentration","Alcohol %","the percent alcohol content of the wine"
"fixed.acidity","Fixed Acidity","tartaric acid - g / dm^3","most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)"
"volatile.acidity","Volatile Acidity","acetic acid - g / dm^3","the amount of acetic acid in wine,which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant,vinegar taste"
"citric.acid","Citric Acid","g/dm^3","found in small quantities,citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines"
"residual.sugar","Residual Sugar","g/dm^3","the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops,it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet"
"chlorides","Chlorides","sodium chlorides g/dm^3","the amount of salt in the wine"
"free.sulfur.dioxide","Free Sulphur Dioxide",mg/dm^3,"the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine"
"total.sulfur.dioxide","Total Sulphur Dioxide" ,"mg/dm^3","amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations,SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine,but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm,SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine"
"density","Density","g/cm^3","the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content"
"pH","pH","","describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale"
"sulphates","Sulphates","potassium sulphate - g / dm3","a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels,wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant"
