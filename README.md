# Summary

A data visualization showing the correlation between alcohol concentration and
perceived wine quality.
The dataset is relative to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.
The visualization showcases one of the most interesting findings during the
exploratory data analysis of the dataset and also allows some exploration.

# Design

The basic idea is to use faceted boxplots for each quality ranking versus the
other variables.
